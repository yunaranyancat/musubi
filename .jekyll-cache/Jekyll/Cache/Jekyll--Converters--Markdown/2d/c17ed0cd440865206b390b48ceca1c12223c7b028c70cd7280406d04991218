<p>I am currently working as a penetration tester at one of the company located in Malaysia. Most of my daily tasks are focused on performing penetration testing, however my end goal is more than what I’m currently doing right now. The journey might not be short, might not be easy, might not be possible, but I have only one goal, and that is to become the best among the best.</p>

<p>Sharing knowledge is one of my favorite activities, because, one day, when I’m old and start forgetting things, all that I know would have been passed on to younger generations and they might have an improvised version of the knowledge. I would also wish that those knowledge would not be kept to themselves and keep on sharing to other people, newcomers and potential future leaders.</p>

<p>Even if I only know very little of the hacking world, I will try my best to share everything I already know so at least it could pave a path to young and aspiring hackers in their pursuit of knowledge.</p>

<p>If you want to know a little bit more about me, wanted to do some collaboration, or even a job offer, you can contact me via my email provided in my Github account.</p>
