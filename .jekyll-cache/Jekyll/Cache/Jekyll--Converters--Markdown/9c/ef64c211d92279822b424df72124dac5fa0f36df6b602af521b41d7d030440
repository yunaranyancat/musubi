<p>Hey there, for today I will make a quick introduction on the upcoming series. This series is targeted to those who wanted to get <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/">OSCP</a> certified and have access to retired machines in <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/retired">HackTheBox</a></p>

<p>This series will include all OSCP-like boxes in HTB. Since I didnâ€™t root a majority of them, so I think this could be that opportunity while preparing myself for OSCP.</p>

<p>Thanks to HTB Discord where I got the summary of OSCP-like boxes, now I can start learning from the boxes and start making writeups/reports/videos in order to have good enumeration skills.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert! The key of success to getting OSCP-certified is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enumerate Harder</code> .</p>

<p>So, here you go!</p>

<p>For now, I will say that most of the writeups that I will do will be based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA">ippsec</a> videos. Whenever I got stuck, I will watch ippsec videos and try to redo it by myself. So, there will be a lot of similarities, but this is one of the way how I learn pentesting and I think itâ€™s working.</p>

<p>So, if you are in the same journey as me, letâ€™s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try harder and harder</code> until we got that OSCP!</p>

<p>If you have something to share with me about ideas of preps for OSCP, do send me a <a href="https://twitter.com/yunaranyancat">tweet</a>! :D</p>
