I"<p>Hey guys, I’m back!</p>

<p><img src="/musubi/assets/osep/kongming.gif" alt="kongming" /></p>

<p>(and I’ll be gone and will be back again.. it will be an endless circle.)</p>

<p>I will be sharing my <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pen300-osep/">OSEP</a> review and some tips that I have used which helped me in the course and also how to maximise knowledge gained so you can apply it in your future pentest engagement!</p>

<p>Let’s go!</p>

<h1 id="pre-osep">Pre OSEP</h1>

<p>Before taking the course, you need to make sure that this course is right for you.</p>

<p>Before I decided to enroll in this course, I already have basic knowledge about Active Directoy infrastructures, configurations, objects, forests, domains, trusts, communications and most importantly what is AD for and why organizations use it especially in a larger scale ones.</p>

<p>I also have participated in red team engagements so I have some ideas on how to conduct a successful red teaming operation.</p>

<p>For me personally, the <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/PEN300-Syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> provided by Offensive Security suits well as a foundation in performing a red teaming operation.</p>

<h1 id="osep">OSEP</h1>

<p>There are three main “concepts” that will be taught in the course:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How to gain initial foothold (Through phishing, web exploitations, etc..)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to attack AD internal network (Misconfigurations abuse, common AD/system vulnerabilities, lateral movement, SQL servers, etc..)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While doing 1. and 2., you also will learn how to bypass standard antivirus programs and application whitelistings so that your payloads/C2 are working as intended.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Below are the methods (although it’s rather conventional) I have used to gain the most out of the course :</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the course videos on one screen and the corresponding PDF content on the other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While watching and reading, take note of the code snippets, specific keywords, new terms, so you can perform a deeper search outside of the course.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever you’re stuck, pause the video, stop scrolling the PDF and read the documentation that’s available online. 
For example, if you don’t know what is <strong>MessageBox</strong>, you can read the official documentation <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messagebox">here</a> or for .NET,	<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.messagebox?view=windowsdesktop-6.0">here</a> , you also will be interested to read <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.messagebox?view=windowsdesktop-6.0">this</a>. Try to understand what are the differences between each <strong>“MessageBox”</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I am planning to take Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO) from Zero Point Security. I’ve been told that it would be a great add to what OSEP currently teach, and based on some reviews, the exams are way harder than OSEP. So, I think with these two courses, I will be able to broaden my knowledge in performing a better red teaming operation than before.</p>
