<p>I have received an email confirmation that I have passed the Certified Red Team Operator exam so I would like to share my review about the <a href="https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/red-team-ops">course</a>.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>For those who didnâ€™t know, I have passed my <a href="https://yunaranyancat.github.io/musubi/others/osepreview">OSEP</a> exam few months ago, and it is one of the reasons why I decided to enroll in CRTO. I wonâ€™t be comparing CRTO and PEN-300 so this review will be focusing on my journey when enrolling in the CRTO course.</p>

<h1 id="course">Course</h1>

<p>The course is pretty straightforward, from external recon until domain compromise. I would say that the course is C2 oriented since most of the time you will be interacting with the compromised machines from Cobalt Strike C2.</p>

<p>You also will be able to experiment with Cobalt Strike different features such as artifact kit, resource kit, threat profile, scripts and many more!</p>

<p>And in the point of view of a blue teamer, you will be able to understand how you can detect malicious activities, rogue processes running on your network.</p>

<p>The best thing about the course is that once you have enrolled, you will get a lifetime access and update of the course, and this could help you build your own methodology for your future red team engagements.</p>

<p>I have a habit of making a cheat sheet for every course I take, but strangely, the content in this course is concise and precise, I can just use it as my cheat sheet!</p>

<h1 id="who-is-this-course-for">Who is this course for?</h1>

<p>I think this is the best course to start your experience as a red teamer! So, if you want to get the feeling of compromising an organizationâ€™s domain, this is your chance.</p>

<h1 id="bonus--how-do-i-pass-the-exam">BONUS : How do I pass the exam?</h1>

<p>The course is short, concise and precise, you just need to fully understand the course content and everything in the exam will feel like a revision! And guess what, itâ€™s an open book exam!</p>
