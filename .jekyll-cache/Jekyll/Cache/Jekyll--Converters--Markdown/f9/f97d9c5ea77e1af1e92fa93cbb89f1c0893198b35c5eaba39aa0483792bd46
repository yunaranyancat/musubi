I"ˇ<p>Hey guys, I‚Äôm back!</p>

<p><img src="/musubi/assets/osep/kongming.gif" alt="kongming" /></p>

<p>(and I‚Äôll be gone and will be back again.. it will be an endless circle.)</p>

<p>I will be sharing my <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pen300-osep/">OSEP</a> experience (of course, without disclosing confidential information that‚Äôs only available to OSEP students) and some tips that I have used which helped me in the course and also how to maximise knowledge gained so you can apply it in your future pentest engagement!</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs go!</p>

<h1 id="pre-osep">Pre OSEP</h1>

<p>Before taking the course, you need to make sure that this course is right for you.</p>

<p>Before I decided to enroll in this course, I already have basic knowledge about Active Directoy infrastructures, configurations, objects, forests, domains, trusts, communications and most importantly what is AD for and why organizations use it especially in a larger scale ones.</p>

<p>I also have participated in red team engagements so I have some ideas on how to conduct a successful red teaming operation.</p>

<p>For me personally, the <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/PEN300-Syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> provided by Offensive Security suits well as a foundation in performing a red teaming operation.</p>

<h1 id="osep">OSEP</h1>

<p>There are three main ‚Äúconcepts‚Äù that will be taught in the course:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How to gain initial foothold (Through phishing, web exploitations, etc..)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to attack AD internal network (Misconfigurations abuse, common AD/system vulnerabilities, lateral movement, SQL servers, etc..)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While doing 1. and 2., you also will learn how to bypass standard antivirus programs and application whitelistings so that your payloads/C2 are working as intended.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Below are the methods (although it‚Äôs rather conventional) I have used to gain the most out of the course :</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the course videos on one screen and the corresponding PDF content on the other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While watching and reading, take note of the code snippets, specific keywords, new terms, so you can perform a deeper search outside of the course.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever you‚Äôre stuck, pause the video, stop scrolling the PDF and read the documentation that‚Äôs available online. 
For example, if you don‚Äôt know what is <strong>MessageBox</strong>, you can read the official documentation <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messagebox">here</a> or for .NET,	<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.messagebox?view=windowsdesktop-6.0">here</a> , you also will be interested to read <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.messagebox?view=windowsdesktop-6.0">this</a>. Try to understand what are the differences between each <strong>‚ÄúMessageBox‚Äù</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="post-osep">Post OSEP</h1>

<p>I am planning to take <strong>Red Team Ops (CRTO)</strong> from <strong>Zero Point Security</strong>. I‚Äôve been told that it would be a great add to what PEN-300 currently offer, and based on some reviews, the exams are way harder than OSEP (they said using bloodhound is a no no). So, I hope, with these two courses, I will be able to broaden my knowledge in performing a better red teaming operation than before.</p>

<h3 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and Tricks</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Understand different ways to exploit AD environment and which settings/misconfigurations can be abused.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don‚Äôt forget about low hanging fruits (sometimes, it is easier/more direct than what you think it is).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don‚Äôt forget simple enumeration techniques to understand in what context are you currently in (are you a local user?,or are you a domain user?, are are you a service account? are you currently in a database server?, or are you in a web server?).
If you are in a webserver, what juicy information can you extract? If you are in a database server, what exploits can you perform? Everything in AD can be treated as objects so it is easier for you to map out it‚Äôs architecture. (or you can just run <a href="https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound">bloodhound</a> lol)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take breaks occasionally, sometimes you may think you have reached a dead end / rabbit hole (because your brain is too tired). Keep in mind that there are different ways to achieve the same objectives. The ideas will come eventually when you have calmed yourself.</p>
