I"Â<p>Hey , Iâ€™m writing this journal that will be updated periodically at the end of the day as I progress through the Web Application Hackerâ€™s Handbook 2nd Edition, then proceed to Web Security Academy which is the â€œsuccessorâ€ of the book and other web application hacking related things. I will write anything that I found useful however, do note that this is more of a journal/diary rather than a complete technical writeup. Letâ€™s go..</p>
