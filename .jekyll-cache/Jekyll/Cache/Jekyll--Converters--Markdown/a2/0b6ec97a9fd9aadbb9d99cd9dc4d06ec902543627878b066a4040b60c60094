I"<p>Musubi is a japanese term of tying or binding together like binding things or connecting people. Long story short, this is what â€œOba-chanâ€ in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kimi no na wa</code> said about Musubi :</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Tying threads is Musubi,    
Connecting people is Musubi,  
The flow of time is Musubi,  
They converge and take shape..   
They twist, tangle..  
Sometimes unravel, break   
Then connect again..  
Musubi - knotting. That's time..  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But why Musubi? Because it is.. Musubi ( Í×¡Ö¼ ÍœÊ–Í¡×¡Ö¼)</p>
