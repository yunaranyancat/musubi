        <p>Hello pentesters and hackers from Malaysia,</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>I would like to invite you guys to join our Discord server.</p>

<p>Click here to join : <a href="https://discord.gg/KPUXr2u">https://discord.gg/KPUXr2u</a></p>

<p><img src="/musubi/assets/discord/discord.png" alt="discord" /></p>

<p>The main reason why I would like to create this post is to list all the rules for those who are currently applying to join our Discord server. This is to avoid spam, posts that violate rules and other things that might make things worst.</p>

<h2 id="general-rules">General Rules</h2>

<h3 id="1-follow-the-rules">1. Follow the rules</h3>

<p>Rules are created to maintain harmony between Discord users. Follow the rules and you can enjoy our Discord server.</p>

<h3 id="2-rudeness--offensive-language">2. Rudeness &amp; Offensive Language</h3>

<p>This Discord server is aimed for all range of users. Even students below 18 years old are welcomed so that they can learn at an early stage. Do not use curse/bad languages. If you’re being caught by the Mods, you’ll be kicked out from the server or get your roles removed for a period of time.</p>

<h3 id="3-welcoming--patience">3. Welcoming &amp; Patience</h3>

<p>Not all of us are pro pentesters, veterans, master hackers or 1337. Please don’t make users feel unwelcomed or unappreciated.</p>

<h3 id="4-drama--arguments">4. Drama &amp; Arguments</h3>

<p>Please refrain yourself from causing a huge drama or arguments. You can simply block the user(s) if you don’t like them.</p>

<h3 id="5-privacy">5. Privacy</h3>

<p>Please respect others privacy. Asking personal questions should be done between only you and the person in question. Send them a PM if they’re available. And don’t PM them if they have set their status as unavailable!</p>

<h2 id="server-rules">Server Rules</h2>

<p>Once you have joined our Discord, please wait some time for Mods to give you a role. If you think that your roles are irrelevant, please do not hesitate to send Mods a PM. And do introduce yourself inside the #welcoming-mat channel.</p>

<h3 id="1-mods-pinging">1. Mods pinging</h3>

<p>Please do not ping Moderators unless you have a very urgent problem. If you would like to report a user(s), send Mods a PM alongside the screenshot(s) of them breaking the rules.</p>

<h3 id="2-channel-relevance">2. Channel relevance</h3>

<p>Please do not SPAM bots (KawaiiBot / Rythm) outside of #bot-spam-and-welcoming-mat text channel. Repeated spamming outside the appropriate channel will result in a temporary ban.</p>

<p>Only post contents in RELEVANT channels.</p>

<p>Rythm</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rythm is a music bot, if you want to listen to the music or request a music, join <code class="highlighter-rouge">music listening</code> voice channel and see available commands by typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">!help</code> in #bot-spam text channel. Please do not spam music requests or skip currently playing music (if you are alone inside the voice channel, then you can do so). And mute your mic in the channel. &gt;.&lt;</li>
</ul>

<p>KawaiiBot</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">+help</code> in #bot-spam channel and you can spam anything inside the channel. But please do not <strong>MEGA SPAM</strong>. Plzzzzzzz. :3</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-illegal-content--topics">3. Illegal Content &amp; Topics</h3>

<p>Please refrain from discussing any unlawful actions, this is not the place to tell people about your blackhat actions, it’s also not very smart. In addition to this, please do not ask anyone to break the law for you, this is not a blackhat recruitment area, we try to maintain a professional environment &amp; discussion of such topics is not professional. Finally, refrain from posting unlawfully gathered content &amp; links to such content, #resources-sharing is there for legally obtained material to be posted (no this does not mean you can share a book because you bought it)</p>

<p>Do not post Torrents or any illegal websites, failure to do so will result in temporary ban. There might be professionals who are working with the polices here.</p>

<h3 id="4-please-use-english--malay-at-all-times">4. Please use English / Malay at all times.</h3>

<p>If you want to use other languages, it is better to do it outside of the channels. This is not a form of discrimination, rather than encouraging people to communicate actively using well known and common languages.</p>

<h3 id="5-tos">5. TOS</h3>

<p>Think before you do anything. We are obligated to operate under Discord TOS too so please make sure that you have fully understood and agreed to those terms.</p>

<h3 id="6-unspoken-rules">6. Unspoken rules</h3>

<p>If you think it’s wrong, then it’s wrong. There is no justification.</p>

<p>Thank you. :D</p>
