## Intro : Preparing OSCP via HTB

Hey there, for today I will make a quick introduction on the upcoming series. This series is targeted to those who wanted to get [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/) certified and have access to retired machines in [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/retired)

This series will include all OSCP-like boxes in HTB. Since I didn't root a majority of them, so I think this could be that opportunity while preparing myself for OSCP.

Thanks to HTB Discord where I got the summary of OSCP-like boxes, now I can start learning from the boxes and start making writeups/reports/videos in order to have good enumeration skills.

Spoiler alert! The key of success to getting OSCP-certified is `Enumerate Harder` .

So, here you go!

For now, I will say that most of the writeups that I will do will be based on [ippsec](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA) videos. Whenever I got stuck, I will watch ippsec videos and try to redo it by myself. So, there will be a lot of similarities, but this is one of the way how I learn pentesting and I think it's working.

So, if you are in the same journey as me, let's `try harder and harder` until we got that OSCP!

If you have something to share with me about ideas of preps for OSCP, do send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/yunaranyancat)! :D
