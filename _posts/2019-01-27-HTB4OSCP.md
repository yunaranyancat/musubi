## Intro : Preparing OSCP via HTB

Hey there, for today I will make a quick introduction on the upcoming series. This series is targetted for those who wanted to get [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/) certified and have access to retired machines in [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/retired)

This series will include all OSCP-like boxes in HTB. Since I didn't rooted a mojority of them, so I think this could be that opportunity while preparing myself for OSCP.

Thanks to HTB Discord where I got the summary of OSCP-like boxes, now I can start learning from the boxes and make writeups/reports/videos in order to have a good enumeration.

Spoiler alert! The key of success to getting OSCP certified is having `Good Enumeration Skills` .

So, here you go!

I will try to create a writeup that is understandable by wide range of audience will not be too lengthy to avoid boredom. XD

So, if you are in the same journey as me, let's `try harder and harder` until we got that OSCP!

If you have something to share with me about OSCP, do send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/yunaranyancat)! :D
