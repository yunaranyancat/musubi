#### Kioptrix Level 1

For my first post, we will start with an easy box called [Kioptrix 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/).

Normally, I will create a specific directory just for a target so I can modify exploits, store scan results, etc and keep it organised.
![mkdir](/musubi/assets/kioptrix_1/mkdir.png)

I will start by running;
>ifconfig

![ifconfig](/musubi/assets/kioptrix_1/ifconfig.png)

to find my current Kali IP and use netdiscover;
>netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.1.0/24

![netdiscover](/musubi/assets/kioptrix_1/netdiscover.png)  

to find the IP of the target, and in this case, the ip is `192.168.1.104` .

After that, I would run the nmap scan to find available services alongside their version.  
>nmap -sS -sV -A -v 192.168.1.104

After few minutes, the scan finished. Based on the image below, we can see open ports such as tcp `22` and http `80`.

It seems that the target is using an old version of Apache, so I tried to find available vulnerabilities using searchsploit.
> searchsploit Apache 1.3.x
> searchsploit mod_ssl 2.8

![searchsploit](/musubi/assets/kioptrix_1/searchsploit.png)

Based on some google searches, I found an exploit called ~~OpenFuck~~, and it is the same as what's stored locally in my Kali machine at;
> /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/unix/remote/764.c

so, I copied the exploit into my current directory and then tried to compile it.

![error](/musubi/assets/kioptrix_1/error.png)

So... what now? hmm.. ok..

Actually, the error occured because I forgot to add `-lcrypto` option. So, I run the compiler again with;
> gcc 764.c -o 764 -lcrypto

and.. I still got some errors. So, after some Google-Fu, I found out that I need to do some few  changes to the code and install a certain library;

first, I installed libssl-dev,

then I included two headers in the exploit code;
>#include <openssl/rc4.h>  
>#include <openssl/md5.h>  
>...

changed the link in the exploit code to ;
>http://packetstormsecurity.nl/0304-exploits/ptrace-kmod.c

and I ran again the compiler with a grin on my face;

![compiled](/musubi/assets/kioptrix_1/compiled.png) ,

and yes, there are some errors again, but, this time, I managed to compile it. So, I started the exploit to see which options should I add;
> ./764  
> ...  
> Usage: ./764 target box [port] [-c N]  
> ...

So, right now, I need to include the target and the box (and if you like, you can specify the port and the count too). Since we already knew that the box is a RedHat Linux and is running `apache-1.3.20`, we are left with two options;

![try_both](/musubi/assets/kioptrix_1/try_both.png)

First, I tried running the exploit using `0x6a` ,

![try_second](/musubi/assets/kioptrix_1/try_second.png)

but it didn't work. After that, I ran it using `0x6b`, and voila! I got a shell..

![gotroot](/musubi/assets/kioptrix_1/got_root.png)

Thank you, that's all for today.
