Musubi is a japanese term of tying or binding together like binding things or connecting people. Long story short, this is what "Oba-chan" in `Kimi no na wa` said about Musubi :

```text
Tying threads is Musubi,    
Connecting people is Musubi,  
The flow of time is Musubi,  
They converge and take shape..   
They twist, tangle..  
Sometimes unravel, break   
Then connect again..  
Musubi - knotting. That's time..  
```

But why Musubi? Because it is.. Musubi ( ͝סּ ͜ʖ͡סּ)
