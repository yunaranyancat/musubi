I have received an email confirmation that I have passed the Certified Red Team Operator exam so I would like to share my review about the [course](https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/red-team-ops).

# Intro

For those who didn't know, I passed my [OSEP](https://yunaranyancat.github.io/musubi/others/osepreview) exam few months ago, and it is one of the reasons why I decided to enroll in CRTO. I won't be comparing CRTO and PEN-300 so this review will be focusing on my journey when enrolling in the CRTO course.

# Course

The course is pretty straightforward, from external recon until domain compromise. I would say that the course is C2 oriented since most of the time you will be interacting with the compromised machines from Cobalt Strike C2.

You also will be able to experiment with Cobalt Strike different features such as artifact kit, resource kit, threat profile, scripts and many more!

And in the point of view of a blue teamer, you will be able to understand how you can detect malicious activities, rogue processes running on your network.

The best thing about the course is that once you have enrolled, you will get a lifetime access and update of the course, and this could help you build your own methodology for your future red team engagements.

I have a habit of making a cheat sheet for every course I take, but strangely, the content in this course is concise and precise, I can just use it as my cheat sheet!

# Who is this course for?

I think this is the best course to start your experience as a red teamer! So, if you want to get the feeling of compromising an organization's domain, this is your chance.

# BONUS : How do I pass the exam?

The course is short, concise and precise, you just need to fully understand the course content and everything in the exam will feel like a revision! And guess what, it's an open book exam!
