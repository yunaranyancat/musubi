**Author** is currently a fresh graduate in Bachelor's Degree of Computer Engineering at University of Orléans, France. His passion for technology, grew considerably stronger through ~~tiring~~ college classes and interesting books he bought online. One day, he asked himself,
>what will I become in the next few years?

After being a college student for almost `4` years (~~get~~ ~~me~~ ~~out~~), did
an internship as a full stack developer for a total of 6 months, he finally concluded, that, becoming a software developer is not the best option, yet. He started to invest his time in learning more about infosec, cybersec, then started to sharpen his arsenal, and now..

he's still a **noob**.

So, here we are.. the long journey of a noob written in this site, and maybe one day, he will be gone before he can become someone that he wanted to... (ㆆᴗㆆ)
