**Author** is currently a first year student in Master's Degree of Computer Engineering at University of Orléans, France. His passion for technology, grew considerably stronger through ~~tiring~~ college classes and interesting books he bought online. One day, he asked himself,
>what will I become in the next few years?

After being a college student for almost `4` years (~~get~~ ~~me~~ ~~out~~), doing an
internship as a back-end developer for `3` months and another `3` months as a front-end developer, he finally concluded, that, becoming a software developer is his second option. He then started to invest his time in learning more about infosec, started to sharpen his arsenal, and now..

he's still a **noob**.

So, here we are.. the long journey of a noob written in this site, and maybe one day, he will be gone before he can become someone that he wanted to... (ㆆᴗㆆ)
